# Academic Hilbert-Huang transform
A light version of Signal Analysis Lab's Hilbert-Huang Transform software for matlab.

## How to use this software?

There are two essential functions to the hht code. It is the emd(·) and the hilbertSpectrum(·). The emd(·) function decomposes an one-dimentional array down to the fewest monocomponents *c*<sup>*i*</sup>(*t*) and one monotonic function *r*(*t*) that is needed to describe it.
